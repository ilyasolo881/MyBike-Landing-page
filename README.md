## MyBike

This project is a one-page website created for bicycle enthusiasts. It reflects a minimalist style and contains information about different types of bicycles designed for both city riding and sport riding in different conditions.

# Functionality:

- Responsive design: The site is optimized for viewing on various devices - phones, tablets, and computers. This ensures comfortable viewing of content regardless of the size of the user's screen.

- Navigation buttons: There are buttons on the page that allow users to easily navigate to the next sections or pages that can be added in the project's future development.

- User form: There is an opportunity for site visitors to send their contact information or requests, which makes the site more interactive and convenient for interaction with the audience.

- Burger menu: The site is navigated through the burger menu, which provides convenient access to all sections and pages of the site without overloading the main interface.

This project was created to promote information about different bicycle types and promote the cycling culture. It combines minimalist design with practical functionality to maximize the convenience of visitors.
